# Water Monitor

## Need
Remote water monitoring systems have not been used effectively in emerging countries. We got motivated to recycle and use old phones and tablets, used devices like computers on providing remote water monitoring facility to prevent havoc in case of hurricanes, excessive rainfall. Chennai floods in 2015 has made it all the more urgent to design, develop and deploy such systems cost effectively.

## What it does
Our vision is to carry out research on new models that incorporate technology and which aims at revolutionizing the water management practices around the world . The technology solution is designed specifically to address the needs of the water, health and environment eco-system comprising of civic bodies, water management units, hospitals, environment and health ministry, laboratories, citizens, R&D organizations and improve the operational efficiencies.

Just in Time service: Availability of city’s water records suffering from environmental issues across different stakeholder through secure blockchain network.

Record Management: Quality documentation reduces the issues regarding implementation of water management policies.

Research: Research laboratories can use the data for diagnosis of water borne diseases, suggesting personalized action to water treatment plants.

Web Application: Cloud-based web application with a chat-based interface for quick water wastage attention. It can also be used for environment protection and steps to reduce the issues.

Transparency Insurance agencies can utilize the data to provide customized house insurance plans to the customer. Ground water levels are at an all time low.

## How we built it

Our solution offers an Artificial Intelligence-based object detection system that utilizes blockchain solutions for sorting information obtained from a variety of water management bodies, cameras deployed at monitoring spots.

Our app will provide the requisites features to share weather conditions like humidity, temperature and conditions and remotely monitor the water management policies in a place using used and broken phones and tablets, alarm clocks, internet connection, sync service, integration with IP cameras, raise safety alarms. The cost of deployment and added technology is limited which could help the families living in a variety of geographical regions.

Blockchain Eco-system:

a. Solana blockchain:

b. Algorand blockchain: Decentralized NFT-based subscription and voting system for contract work for service & maintenance providers and companies and Aerial Traffic Control. DAOs can issue NFTs to wallets based on service and maintenance performance and work completed, and the holders of these NFTs can create proposals and vote on other proposals whilst they have the NFTs of that contract work.

We are also developing an NFT creation, subscription and minting system on Algorand for NFC tags of drones: please visit: https://github.com/seetadev/WaterMonitor/tree/main/Algorand-nft-subscription-contracts

Community Tooling using Solana and Algorand for analytics, collaboration and real time monitoring: https://github.com/seetadev/WaterMonitor/tree/main/Community-Tooling-Solana-Algorand

c. Covalent and RockX: We are developing 2 Covalent API Endpoints, one for fetching the total water incidents reported by citizens and solved by government agencies and the other for fetching the token_ids of Water Incident snapshot and Alarm NFT Contract. Cronos: Please visit https://github.com/seetadev/WaterMonitor/tree/main/Chronos

d. Aeternity: We are utilizing Aeternity for scaling web3 solutions focused on ownership of water meters and real estate:

a. NFT collection and NFTs on the æternity blockchain using the AEX-141 standard: We are extending the development on two use cases:

Unique NFTs (for unique assets)
Edition NFTs using templates (for mobility)

Please visit https://github.com/seetadev/WaterMonitor/tree/main/aeternity-solution/aex141-nft-collection/aex141-nft-collection-example-master

b. We are using AEproject to run a local dev environment & test ownable.aes and smartrealestate.aes Smart Contracts.
Please visit https://github.com/seetadev/WaterMonitor/tree/main/aeternity-solution/aepp-sophia-ownables-assets/aepp-sophia-examples-master

c. We are extending the development of ownables.aes (please visit https://github.com/seetadev/WaterMonitor/blob/main/aeternity-solution/aepp-sophia-ownables-assets/aepp-sophia-examples-master/contracts/Ownable/Ownable.aes ) and smartrealestate.aes ( please visit https://github.com/seetadev/WaterMonitor/blob/main/aeternity-solution/aepp-sophia-ownables-assets/aepp-sophia-examples-master/contracts/SmartRealEstate/SmartRealEstate.aes ) 


We also plan to utilize SocialCalc, one of our open source spreadsheet projects and customize it for developing water monitoring and sewage management application. Features include Tabulation that enables the user to enter and edit data in a tabular format; Organization that enables the user to organize the tabular matter in several forms, Facilitates sorting of numeric data, comments to increase ease of understanding of data, names to access data in different modalities, clipboard function; Collaboration and the ability to support sharing of data over the network and multi-user editing and Interoperability between SocialCalc and Excel (.xls format), csv format.

Quality Assurance and Water Recyclability : Our serverless solution equips with two general purpose object detection engines detect 20 object types in real-time and 80 object types & better accuracy a bit slower. Our software will turns any IP camera to an AI beast within the snap of a finger. IPFS & Ethereum, Hedera Hashgraph is a seamless solution to keep data encrypted and place the immutable fingerprints into blockchain transactions. With just a cell phone, users are offered a serverless solution that can detect objects in water in real time and more object types for better accuracy.

Technologies Used: JavaScript, CSS, Tornado Python Web Framework, Swift, Yolo Machine Learning Library, Ionic Framework, Polygon, IPFS, NFT.Storage, Hedera Hashgraph, Polygon Testnet

Polygon: We are utilizing ZoraModuleManager, and ZoraProtocolFeeSettings in our our dapp and deploying it on Polygon after registering the Zora market module. We are developing a crowdsourcing marketplace using Zora's auction house template for enabling sharing of government assets like prepaid card, meter details information, meter license management and quarterly pollution check and control. We are using the zora starter kit to access ZORA API, Creator Toolkit, and Marketplace Hyperstructure. Zora's Auction House template is being utilized for NFT marketplace of alarm clock wallpapers and background ringtones purchase and auction. We are also extending and adapting Turtle Music using NFT Experiments for music curators for alarm clock. We are using DAOtooling for coordination with a social focus around community collaboration for water management incidents and alarms.

## What we learned
We can utilize SocialCalc, Machine Learning Models coupled with Chronos testnet powered by RockX and Covalent, Hedera Hashgraph, decentralized Polygon, NFT.Storage, network tools, ethereum based infrastructure tools for analysis and prediction of incidents to provide early stage detection and prevention of water borne diseases. We also witnessed the great eco-system available to developers to learn and contribute in the Ethereum eco-system.

## What's next for Water Monitor
The platform is currently running on Chronos testnet powered by RockX and Covalent, Hedera Hashgraph, and SAP Hana platform. We still need focus on key performance indicators like throughput and measure the performance of our smart contracts before moving to mainnet. We plan to utilize tools like blocktest for measuring and benchmarking our smart contracts and unit tests on a variety of key parameters like throughput, latency. We also wish to test our solution using AWS templates on compliance and security.
